Hi 👋, I'm Guillaume, a software developer living in London.

I like working with Python on the backend. My favourite framework is FastAPI. For the frontend I like using TypeScript with React.

I'm working on two long term projects at the moment:

1. Chalkr - an iOS climbing app to track and provide insights into my bouldering sessions
2. Velock - a web app that lets users organise frequently uses Santander Docking stations into specific lists.

Other than that I enjoy creating small little tools that makes life easier. Latest being <www.streamto.stream> which automatically converts Tidal into Spotify streaming links (and vice-versa) so I can share bangers with my friends.
